Lock my funds because of your mistake? Have your bank's social media ruined,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1n6k4ph/lock_my_funds_because_of_your_mistake_have_your/,"For some reason, god knows why, I thought I'd trust a very small and local credit union with some of my money. When recently my card didn't work on the ATM, I asked for help inside the branch and a clerk gave me a code to use that would deduct cash directly from my account. This is a feature the bank has, I wasn't having special treatment.

Fast forward a few days, it seems the bank's system flagged my account for review because of some accounting error being late to deduct my balance. I didn't go on overdraft or anything. It was just a minor mistake from their side. And still... For over a month all my funds were locked and whenever I'd call my bank's support I was given snarky responses, sometimes even hinting that they didn't like my foreign sounding last name.

When I spoke to my family back home to vent about this situation, a younger cousin came up with an idea. Use some Russian service that pays people a few Russian Rubbles (1 RUB is approximately 1 USD cent for reference) each time to post whatever you ask them on social media.

This service worked like magic. The website even had the option to choose between American looking profiles and other locales. After the most well spent 3$ of my life and some AI prompts later, the credit union's social media were flooded with hundreds of complaints. I'm sure this got to the right ears because on the same day....

The bank's call center manager personally called me to say they understand my frustration and even if I don't want my account anymore, the bank is ready to initialize a transfer of my full balance, plus 50$ compensation to any other bank of my choosing.

Problem solved. They probably also realized there was no way to link this activity to me and hence hinted at ending things on a positive note. Too bad I can't tell the Russian bots to remove their posts. That will be someone else's problem now.",0
Woman takes revenge against car dealership,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1mek0t7/woman_takes_revenge_against_car_dealership/,"""An Ohio woman, whose car was repossessed by the dealership just one month after she bought it, has pulled off a revenge move for the ages.

"Classmate got ""pranked"" by fake letter after screwing us over (old story)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1lre8t4/classmate_got_pranked_by_fake_letter_after/,"This is a very old revenge from when I was a teenager in the 90's.

There were only a few PC gamers around at the time and without Internet it was hard to get hold of new games. Me & a friend bought games from abroad via airmail because local stores didn't sell many but these weren't cheap. We'd trade them with each-other and would copy the copy protection (which was often included) so this made it semi-affordable for us.   
  
A new kid joined our class however and his uncle had tons and tons of games we didn't have. We offered to trade games with him & gave him our original copies for him to copy and in return we got ... corrupted floppies (yes this was the 90's), missing copy protection, etc. and after a few months of this we received not a SINGLE working game while he had received all of our games (The Settlers, Doom II, Monkey Island games, etc.) and some he returned in less than nice condition. We had enough and we wanted to get revenge but we didn't know how.   
  
Now, the 90's were known for the many AIDS campaigns after Freddie Mercury died of AIDS in 1991. I was a huge fan of Queen and this new ""friend"" would often mock me for liking a ""gay"" singer. He came from a VERY conservative family & his mother was quite catholic & this is what gave us an idea when we had to attend an AIDS event organised by a certain foundation with our class. At the end we were given flyers about AIDS, homosexuality, etc. and free condoms with the logo of the AIDS foundation were up for grabs. We each grabbed a few for reasons you'll soon reach below.

Me and my friend were one of the very few with a computer & inkjet printer at home so we got this idea to screw him over: we created a fake letter addressed to our ""friend"" pretending we were the AIDS foundation copying the logo and everything to make it look as authentic as possible. It went something like this:

""Dear FIRST NAME,

Thank you for your letter. We understand it's difficult being open about being homosexual and you have many questions after the event you attended with your class. Please find enclosed a flyer which should answer many of your questions as well as some condoms. Please practice safe sex at all times.""

We enclosed all the flyers we had gotten at the event as well as the condoms and mailed it to ""Mr LASTNAME"" to guarantee his father would open the letter first. 

We had no idea the shit storm this would create - we knew him being homophobic this would be great revenge but apparently his mother had been in tears, screaming, his father angry & he was grounded for weeks with his parents convinced he was gay.  
  
In the end he figured we had something to do with it because we had been carefully fishing to see if our prank had succeeded but at first he thought the letter was authentic and we had contacted the foundation in his name. When we finally confessed we had faked it all, we had a nice trip to the principal to explain why we had done this WITH his parents present.

It's still the best revenge I ever took in my life even though it was 30 years ago.",0
Hurt my Friend? Good luck with your education.,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1kodd4f/hurt_my_friend_good_luck_with_your_education/,"(I recognize this is long. Feel free to skip if you don't have the time or patience üòé Also if this more Petty than Pro I can move it)

Back in the before times when the Internet was still a new thing with lots of potential, I was enrolled at my local junior college. A little into the semester, I moved in with my GF so we could both save on rent. I will call my girlfriend ‚ÄúLucy‚Äù for the purposes of this post.

One night Lucy says she invited a friend from one of her classes for a game night. Sounded good to me. We invited a couple of other friends and it was a really fun night. Surprisingly, it turned out her friend (Sara) was someone I knew from high school. We weren‚Äôt close friends, but we knew each other and got along fine. 

After that night, Sara was invited over pretty frequently for dinner, game nights, or to watch a movie. She even brought her boyfriend over a couple of times (I‚Äôll call him Jay), but he never quite fit in. He would be quiet and/or standoffish‚Ä¶ wouldn‚Äôt engage much, and just seemed like he never wanted to be there. It was clear no one really felt comfortable having him there, but we invited him to be polite to Sara. Fortunately, he only came over 2 or 3 times, and found an excuse to refuse every other time.

A month or two after this all started, Sara called my GF crying and asked if she could come over. Of course we said yes.

The story that was relayed was Jay was getting very upset with Sara for coming over to our place so frequently and accused her of cheating on him. She never clarified if he thought she was cheating with me, Lucy, or both, but any option was ridiculous and never happened. But he confronted her and started verbally assaulting her, calling her all kinds of nasty names. At one point she tried to walk past him to leave, and he shoved her back. This caused her to trip over a coffee table, fall, and get a huge bruise on her butt and lower back (Lucy told me about the bruise as Sara had shown her; I didn‚Äôt see it for myself).

Sara swore up and down that he had never physically assaulted her before, and she believed it was just an accident, but I was PISSED. I wanted revenge. You don‚Äôt mess with my friends, and you don‚Äôt assault women. I wanted to beat the crap out of him, but while I‚Äôm a very big guy, I‚Äôve never been in a fight and am not a violent person, but a revenge plan formed in my mind.

At the time I was working in the administration building of the school as a student employee. As part of my job I could access anyone‚Äôs student records, their fees, and their class schedule.  The date was fast approaching that was the last possible day to drop or add classes without penalty or specific permission, so I looked Jay up in the system, got his student ID number and the other information that I needed, and put my plan into motion. On the last day to change schedules I used the dedicated enrollment phones in the administration building (internet class scheduling wasn‚Äôt a thing that was set up yet) and cancelled ALL of his classes. Not only that, but I went through and added every class I could find that had a course fee. If you owed a debt at the school, you couldn‚Äôt get copies or your transcripts or anything else. 

Something that I didn‚Äôt mention was that Jay was a foreign student, and couldn‚Äôt stay in the country if he wasn‚Äôt enrolled with a certain number of units.

I wish I could give more info about the fallout, but as I didn‚Äôt want to get this traced back to me, I didn‚Äôt tell anyone, nor did I pull up his records again for quite a while. I did get a little payoff though. Sara was really worried about seeing him again (she had broken up with him the night after he pushed her), as they had an English class together on Tuesdays. She said that on Tuesday he was there, but there was also someone new standing in the class. He was standing because there weren‚Äôt enough seats. The teacher, seeing that there were more people than should be held roll‚Ä¶ and guess who wasn‚Äôt on it? You‚Äôre right, it was Jay!

Apparently after I dropped all his classes, someone on the waitlist got in. Jay tried to argue with the teacher, but as Teach had the official class roster, and Jay wasn‚Äôt on it, there was nothing he could do.

Sara said she never saw Jay in that class again.

I don‚Äôt know much more about what happened. Lucy and I eventually broke up, so I didn‚Äôt see Sara very often after that. After a while I did look up Jay‚Äôs class schedule, and all of the classes with course fees were gone, but he didn‚Äôt have any other classes on the books either. I wanted to assume he was kicked out of school, but I didn‚Äôt try to confirm it.

Either way, Sara didn‚Äôt have to have a class with him, and while he probably deserved more, he was DEFINITELY inconvenienced and possibly kicked out of school. Sometimes I worry I was too harsh, but then I remember that he deserved it. 

Mess with me, but not my friends.",0
My ex-MIL sent her Church friends to harass my daughters and I. I have now exposed her family to her church community and she's getting shamed and shunned at Church.,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1jcw2ll/my_exmil_sent_her_church_friends_to_harass_my/,"My (46F) daughters (17 and 15) have a strained relationship with my ex-husband's parents (78M and 80F). My ex passed away in an accident last year and we've had some major family drama since due his cheating and him leaving two boys born with his affair partner orphaned. She also died. Part of the drama has been my ex-inlaws trying to get custody of my daughters and them also trying to live with us. First one we're going to court over, second one will never happen.

Where we live there's a weekend market with fresh produce, eggs, meats, and other products straight from farmers. This week was extra special since it was my youngest' birthday. Since her party is later in the month, I decided to give her a budget and set her loose on the market to get whatever she wanted. Mostly chocolate and sweets.

After an hour, I did start getting worried, and just before I called her, she called me. She was crying, saying some weird people have cornered her. I ran to her with my oldest daughter to find six older women berating my daughter for being 'unChristian' for refusing to spend time with her paternal Grandparents or for wanting to be 'a good big sister to her poor orphaned baby brothers'. My daughters are the ones that found out about my ex cheating and the babies, so they aren't fond of the kids. It's trauma and they are working with a therapist.

I got between the group and my daughter, telling my eldest to go pay the stuff her sister had and to go to the car. Then I turned to the women, some who I knew from when we went to my ex-inlaws' church, and rip them a new one. They told me I was worst for refusing to obey my ex-inlaws 'like a good Christian wife'. Barf. Eventually the screaming turn too loud and we were all asked to leave the market. I met with my girls in the car, the women following me like a group of vultures. I managed to get in the car and drove away.

After my girls went to bed, I got online to talk to another member of that church that I'm in good terms. I told him about what happened and after he apologized, he told me what was going on. My ex-mother-in-law posted this massive story in the church's facebook group about how horrible my daughters and I are, how we are leaving them homeless and penniless (they inherited my ex' personal bank account and his life insurance), and how my daughters don't even talk to them. She also accused us of  being the reasons she lost her grandsons. The boys are now living with distant relatives of my ex-husband. Basically, it was a sob story worthy of a Hallmark movie. And of course, they were getting all the love and support from the more extremist members of their church.

This church and its members are a bit annoying especially with LGBTQ+ topics, but they have a small saving grace. They are incredibly strict about cheating. It's a big no-no, be it from a husband or a wife equally. Now, how did she get around blaming me about affair children without exposing the cheating? She claimed the other woman was our surrogate since I was unable to have more children. Then said I didn't want the babies because they were boys. Which is absolutely disgusting to be accused of.

Well, I decided it was time to clean up this mess and since I was mid-divorce when my ex died, I had all the evidence needed. And since the divorce wasn't completed, I don't have any legal ramification for releasing all the evidence.

I was off the next day and went to a print shop to get copies of all the delightful pictures of my ex cheating, his text conversations with his affair partner, the ones with his parents confessing to his cheating and getting support from them, my ex-inlaws harassing me about the divorce, and my coup-de-grace: all the emails and text messages of them bullying my daughters about their baby brothers. In one of them they call my daughters 'bastards' and telling them it was their fault their father died since they told me about the affair and I began the divorce. This one was literally two days after my ex died.

I paid extra for all of this to be printed in beautiful high quality paper. Then when I got home, I sat down for hours to make delightfully personalized binders. They look like the little prayer song packets the church give for everyone to take to sing hymns. The first picture when opening the binders is my ex and his side woman making out in our living room. Their faces are easy to discern and the girl looks nothing like me. Different skin tones and hair color. Underneath I wrote: 'Ex-husband's name' and 'Affair girl's name' love story. I took them to the church before service. There's a desk in the back with the song books for people that need/forget their own, and they never check them.

The gossip mill was quick and harsh. The names my ex and his affair partner got called in the facebook were so bad the pastor himself had to get involved just to keep things relatively PG-13. People were angry at my ex-inlaws for their abused to my daughters, but what made me laugh was that I was still in the wrong for the divorce, but 'it is understandable that I failed on my duties after the shock and I possibly will one day return to the light, unlike my cheating husband and his Jezebel'. They used another word I can't use here, I imagine. I got two apology letters in the mail for my girl and an invitation to join the church for 'support'.

As for my ex-inlaws? They got shamed into leaving the church. My ex-mother-in-law made a post on her wall about how alienated she feels and how no one cares for the elderly anymore. How she wished her 'great son' was still alive since he would have taken care of her and her husband. With what money, I don't know, since I was the bread winner.

**Explanation on the will:** My ex-husband had a will that named his parents as beneficiaries. As far as I was aware, he had told me he had named our daughters, not them. I never pushed for ME to be the beneficiary as my own will has my daughters as the beneficiaries, not him. ",0
The HOA President's Long Goodbye,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1hp67gl/the_hoa_presidents_long_goodbye/,"Posting on behalf of a friend who isn't on reddit. This is for you, Jake!

-------

When I moved into my suburban neighborhood, I expected peace and quiet. Instead, I walked into a petty dictatorship run by our HOA president, Todd. Todd was the worst kind of leader: the kind who loved power but hated accountability. He enforced ridiculous rules‚Äîlike fining people $200 for leaving their trash cans out a minute past 9:00 AM‚Äîbut blatantly ignored the rules when it suited him. His own yard was a mess of unpermitted structures, and his fence was taller than allowed by city ordinances. But Todd's true sin? Using the HOA as his personal piggy bank.

At first, I tried reasoning with him. My fence was slightly off-color because the approved stain wasn‚Äôt available, and he fined me $500. I explained, provided receipts, and asked for leniency. Todd smirked, said, ‚ÄúRules are rules,‚Äù and walked away. That‚Äôs when I decided I would take him down‚Äînot with screaming or public arguments, but methodically, legally, and in a way he‚Äôd never recover from.

---

### **Step One: Become the Inside Man**  
Todd‚Äôs first mistake was underestimating me. I volunteered for the HOA board under the guise of wanting to ""get involved in the community."" I played the part of the eager, na√Øve newbie perfectly. For two years, I attended every meeting, quietly observing how Todd operated. I learned he controlled the board by bullying other members and burying them in paperwork. He‚Äôd push through votes when only his allies were present and conveniently ‚Äúlose‚Äù paperwork submitted by dissenting homeowners. 

I kept my head down, took detailed notes, and waited. My goal was to outlast his term as president so I could begin making changes. Then I discovered Todd‚Äôs second mistake: he wasn‚Äôt just a bully; he was a thief.

---

### **Step Two: Follow the Money**  
Todd loved to brag about how he kept the HOA‚Äôs finances in order. But something didn‚Äôt add up. The annual HOA fees were high‚Äîmuch higher than in similar neighborhoods‚Äîbut the common areas were falling apart. The pool was closed half the summer due to ""maintenance issues,"" and the landscaping looked like it hadn‚Äôt been touched in months.

I started digging. As the HOA treasurer, Todd had access to all the accounts, but he was notoriously cagey about sharing financial details. I asked for the budget during a meeting, and Todd laughed it off, saying, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôve got it under control.‚Äù I filed a formal request for the financial records, which, under HOA rules, he was required to provide. Weeks went by with no response. That‚Äôs when I started talking to neighbors.

Turns out, I wasn‚Äôt the only one suspicious. Over a dozen homeowners had requested access to the budget over the years, only to be ignored. One neighbor claimed Todd had used HOA funds to install a new patio at his house, while another swore he‚Äôd seen Todd‚Äôs kids at the community pool during its ""maintenance closure."" Armed with these suspicions, I filed a formal complaint with the HOA board, forcing Todd to provide the records. He stalled, but I wasn‚Äôt backing down.

---

### **Step Three: Build the Case**  
When Todd finally handed over the financial documents, they were a mess. Invoices were missing, payments were mislabeled, and some expenses were downright bizarre. A $15,000 ‚Äúlandscaping fee‚Äù paid to a company that didn‚Äôt exist. Thousands spent on ‚Äúadministrative costs‚Äù with no explanation. I cross-referenced the HOA‚Äôs bank statements with public records and found the smoking gun: Todd was funneling money to his personal accounts. 

Even better, I discovered Todd had been inflating contractor fees, pocketing the difference, and splitting the profits with his buddy, a shady contractor who ‚Äúhandled‚Äù most of the HOA‚Äôs maintenance. I compiled everything into a detailed report, complete with spreadsheets, photos, and notarized statements from neighbors who had seen Todd's antics firsthand.

---

### **Step Four: The Coup**  
I waited for the annual HOA meeting, which was typically a snooze fest attended by only a handful of homeowners. But this time, I made sure people showed up. I spent weeks knocking on doors, explaining what Todd had been up to. I didn‚Äôt share everything‚Äîjust enough to get people angry and curious. On the night of the meeting, the room was packed.

Todd started the meeting like usual, droning on about how ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù it was to manage the HOA and how much he‚Äôd sacrificed for the community. That‚Äôs when I stood up. I calmly asked if he could explain some discrepancies in the budget. Todd laughed nervously and said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think this is the time or place.‚Äù I replied, ‚ÄúActually, Todd, it‚Äôs the perfect time.‚Äù 

I handed out copies of my report to everyone in the room. The mood shifted instantly. People started reading, whispering, and then shouting. Todd tried to regain control, but it was too late. I called for a vote to remove him as president. By the end of the night, Todd was out.

---

### **Step Five: The Final Blow**  
After Todd was removed, we hired an independent auditor to go through the HOA‚Äôs finances. They confirmed everything: Todd had embezzled over $50,000, mismanaged tens of thousands more, and committed multiple counts of fraud. We reported him to the police and filed a civil lawsuit to recover the stolen funds.

But it didn‚Äôt end there. Todd‚Äôs shady contractor buddy was also exposed and banned from doing business in the county. Todd had to sell his house to pay restitution and legal fees. His name became a running joke in the neighborhood, and no one would touch him professionally. 

With Todd gone, we restructured the HOA to prevent another dictator from taking over. We implemented term limits, required multiple board members to approve financial decisions, and created an online portal so all homeowners could access budgets and meeting minutes.

---

### **The Aftermath**  
Every time I walk past Todd‚Äôs old house, now owned by a lovely family, I smile. The pool is open, the landscaping is beautiful, and the HOA fees are lower than ever. Todd, meanwhile, moved to a neighboring town, where he reportedly tried to join another HOA board‚Äîonly to be laughed out of the room when someone Googled his name.

Cheat on your wife with mine? I will burn your life to the ground. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1gtlcm5/cheat_on_your_wife_with_mine_i_will_burn_your/,"Way back in the early 2000‚Äôs, I began to suspect that my wife was up to something. Our two kids were about 4 and 6, still young, but not so young they couldn‚Äôt tell you something about what had happened in their day. They started talking a lot about staying with my wife‚Äôs parents during the day which wasn‚Äôt really that strange in and of itself, but since they lived about 90 minutes away, doing so two or three times a week seemed a bit much (that was basically every day she wasn‚Äôt working at her part time job). 

When I asked her about it, she denied it, but was never a good liar. So, I started tracking the mileage on her car and sure enough, she was driving an extra 400 or so miles per week. I knew some shit was going on. 

Then one day I sat down at the computer and she had left a sticky note with her AOL password written on it next to the keyboard. I could not resist and logged in to read her emails and saw a few email exchanges between her and her college BFF where they discussed how my wife was regularly fucking one of her ex bf‚Äôs from high school.  No mention of details about him other than my wife also talking shit about his wife making fun of how she‚Äôd gotten fat after having kids. Anyway, I printed out these email exchanges and stashed them. 

I still needed to know the details, so I called a friend who was a cop and he suggested I call a guy he knew that had left the force to become a PI. ‚ÄúRon‚Äù was great, I paid his retainer and gave him the emails and what little I knew about my wife‚Äôs activities and he figured out exactly what she was doing. His report detailed with photos and times/dates/locations all about how she would take the kids to her parent‚Äôs, then go meet this guy for lunch, then they‚Äôd go to a dumpy motel for a few hours, after which she‚Äôd pick up the kids and return home. 

At this point, I hired a divorce lawyer. My parents cheated on each other and the fallout absolutely fucked mine and my siblings‚Äô childhood. It was something that was totally unacceptable. 

I also asked Ron to find out what he could about this guy. Ron absolutely came through. I learned his name (‚ÄúBob‚Äù) , that he was married and had 3 kids. I also found out that he worked as a VP of sales for his father in law‚Äôs business. Hmmmm. 

At this point, I had my lawyer draw up the  divorce papers. I also asked Ron for a couple more copies of his report and I one more thing I wanted him to do for me. 

On the same day I had my wife served with the divorce papers at her work, I had Ron meet with this guy‚Äôs wife and show her everything he‚Äôd found out. She seemed nice and I figured that she deserved to know what her dear hubby was up to. What she did with that information was up to her. 

While the information about my wife‚Äôs infidelity didn‚Äôt really matter in my divorce proceedings, Bob‚Äôs wife did a real number on him. According to the publicly available court documents from the divorce and other related proceedings, she cleaned out their joint account, took the kids and left. As soon as her dad found out what he‚Äôd done, Bob was fired and since her parents actually owned the house where Bob and his wife lived, he also got evicted. Their divorce was ugly. Lots of fighting in ( and evidently out of) court. I guess Bob went to the house and started arguing with his wife and it escalated to the point the her brother stepped in and Bob got his nose broken. There were restraining orders, a few more incidents with police reports, criminal charges, jail time and so on. 

I can‚Äôt find Bob on the internet anywhere these days. Last I heard, he‚Äôd left the state and His ex wife did ok, she went to work at her dad‚Äôs company and took over after he retired. 

As for me, my ex and I got along well enough, I didn‚Äôt engage with her on anything that wasn‚Äôt related to the kids and now that they‚Äôre both adults, I don‚Äôt talk to her at all anymore. I don‚Äôt hate her or anything, but I only care in the context that she is my kids‚Äô mom and is important to them, nothing beyond that. ",0
"Neighbor was stealing water from my supply, so I ruined him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1gm2riq/neighbor_was_stealing_water_from_my_supply_so_i/,"I live in Asia, and just purchased a new house. Now, the previous owners were family friends who needed cash urgently and haven't been living in my country for nearly 3 years. So I got it for a great price in the middle of the capital city.

The sale was finalized at the start of this month and I moved in right after. The house was definitely a fixer upper, as the previous owners had left mid renovation and the main door was locked with just a padlock, not even a door lock. 

The house had no gate, meaning anyone could just walk right on in. The first day I moved in, someone's bike was parked in the garage. I just parked it on the road on the same day I had a gate installed. An angry man was knocking on my gate later and I didn't bother answering, but through my window I could see him giving up and taking the bike after 15 minutes. 

So already, I wasn't digging the neighborhood. But I didn't have any incidents after that, aside from people not knowing that this was no longer an abandoned house, so my gate was blocked more often than never but a ""No Parking"" sign on my gate fixed that issue. 

Last week, I was having a shower in my bathroom and I noticed my water pressure was lower than usual. I also heard my next door neighbors water pump going. Now this neighbor, an old guy, lived in a 3 storied house, the first being the lowest and the one he lived in. The other two floors were rented out to tenants. 

This guy wasn't happy about the house being sold, and voiced many concerns to my friends the previous owners. He was super angry about it, and my friends did warn me but I'm a 6ft guy with 3 dogs. No way he was doing anything and yep, he didn't. 

So with this living situation, a water pump is needed to pump water to the tanks on the roof, since the public supply's pressure is not enough to get it up 3 stories. 

Now, I heard the water pump going and immediately was suspicious. Sure, coincidences exist, but it wouldn't hurt to check it out. I waited till his pump turned off, and then turned on different taps in the house. Sure enough, the pressure was back to normal. 

This made me even more suspicious, but if he was stealing water, it also made sense. The water bills had been going up over the years this house wasn't lived in, but the house also had some water leaks. So it was chalked up to that, even if the bills were too high to be caused just by leaks. Now it's starting to make sense. 

At some point in the last 3 years, this old miser thought he'd save the cost of paying for water, and waltzed into the property and is siphoning water from my lines. I couldn't find where exactly he was siphoning water from, but after checking my pressure multiple times, I was pretty sure.

So I sat on it for a few days, thinking if I should confront him, go the legal path or just let it be. Now, water in my country is very cheap. My total bill, even with washing 3 animals, a car every week and watering my garden only cost like $5 per month, even with the neighbor also stealing some of it. 

But it wasn't about how much I was paying or who was paying for it. It's about entitled old people who think that they're deserving of using other people's resources without paying for it, and then getting away with it. It didn't sit right with me, and I really wanted to teach him a lesson. 

What I did was really simple. I just turned off my water from the mains. I wouldn't have to break into his property, nor would I be breaking any laws. It was the best way of getting back at him without needing to even lift a muscle. 

So on Monday, just 4 days ago, I waited till the pump flicked on, and turned off the supply. Now, the way household tanks work in my country, is that there's a ball valve in the tank which detects the level of water and turns on the pump. If the level doesn't increase, the valve stays open which electronically sends a signal to the pump to stay on until the level gets to a point at which the valve closes and also shuts off the pump. 

However, the level wasn't increasing and anyone knows that starving a pump of water isn't a good idea. This way, my expectation was that I'd burn out his pump and cause issues with his tenants. 

What I didn't account for is that his pump running constantly would mess up the fuses by constantly drawing power overnight and absolutely destroy his wiring. If he decided to upgrade his household wiring to a more modern standard, this would've been prevented. This house clearly still had 90s era wiring. 

At around 3AM, I heard all residents in the house waking up and talking in hushed voices about why just their house in the neighborhood doesn't have power or water. I found out about the power part, because the tenants devolved into shouting at their landlord. 

Our tenant protection laws are very important, and power and water are classed as essential even on a state level. Cutting those services are grounds for lawsuits, unless due to weather or some other unavoidable reason. 

In this case, the landlord is responsible for keeping the house wiring up to date and in good condition, alongside the supply of water. So the tenants were not happy and one of them immediately moved out two days later when it was informed that water and power will not be returning the very same day this happened. 

Both tenants in the two floors lodged a complaint with the police, and if a person is in clear breach of laws, the police have the authority to fine or penalize the person without a court judgment. It can be challenged in court if the person thinks that they were unfairly penalized, but they still have to pay the fines and will only be refunded if and when the court finds the fines unlawful.

So now, the landlord lost both tenants and has to pay a fine of $500, which is a lot of money in our country. He also has to refund the security deposits of both tenants, and cannot rent out until both issues are fixed, which will cost him more money. 

As of right now, he's moving out on Sunday to his daughter's place since he cannot afford to live alone. The tenants were his only source of income, and he's a retired mechanic, so he has no other income. 

He did find out why the motor kept drawing power, overloaded the wiring and burned out. He came by to my gate and asked me if I turned off my water, and I said ""oh yeah, my tank had a new leak on a pipe and I turned it off till the next day until the plumber came by to fix the issue"".

Y'all, the look on his face. He kept a straight one, but I just knew he was holding back. He just said ""oh okay"" and went back inside. Not sure if he knows I know, but I don't care because he can't do anything. 

I'm getting a plumber down next week to correct my plumbing and remove any pipes that leave my property. So I got rid of my water issue and a neighbor who could potentially be a pain in the ass, by simply flicking a tap off. Two birds one stone I'd say. 

TLDR: Bought an abandoned house, neighbor was siphoning water from my supply. Turned off my water supply when the motor was running, motor burned out the wiring in the house and cut off water and power to him and his tenants. Tenants lodged police complaints and the landlord got fined, is now destitute and forced to move in with his daughter.",0
"If you're gonna steal the catalytics off my truck you should've checked if they were actually functional first, wasn't so funny when it was turn.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1g13tpw/if_youre_gonna_steal_the_catalytics_off_my_truck/,"Was a fun morning at the beginning of last week starting up my truck and waking everyone up at 2:45am to learn someone swiped the hollowed out cats. The idiots missed the neighbors cameras that basically gave away who they were. Its two kids from the area who drive around in a pretty busted up police crown vic. I chose not to call the cops, instead I called one of my friends who's code enforcement and let him know what my plan was and he relayed the info to the police that I was finally going to do a nuisance tow on that same crown victoria 


The car they drive isnt street legal as it has no license plates or insurance or working taillights and rattles like shit due to the trash sound system they also spend their whole day at a chicken shack smoking. Not sure who theyre getting money from but I'm guessing stealing catalytics was part of the equation. When I spotted the car sitting on a quiet street I called it in and got the go ahead to tow. I took it straight to the police station and they tried to run a owner check with the vin number only to find out it hadn't been registered since 2011 and the owner was someone other than the kids who sold them the car with no title because of all the back registration  owed 


 The cops said we can go ahead and take it to the junkyard til they can get a Black title(aka certificate of destruction). By then the two idiots were running around all over town looking for their car thinking it got stolen by one of their friends as a prank(the key lock was so worn out you could start it with any car key). They found it at the junkyard and tried to steal it by one of them distracting the owner and the other stealing their car but the junkyard was aware of who they were so they cut the driveshaft off beforehand.
 

I missed out on this part but they got arrested for trying to steal their car back and they watched as the junkyard used a crane to rip the car to shreds when I saw it the remains looked like a toddler just ripped it to the bare frame out of curiosity. They been out of jail since but haven't left their trailer, i did a drive by earlier and noticed a beater jeep liberty in their driveway also with no plates and already working with the cops on taking that too if I see it out in a public except I won't miss the show next time.

Tricking My Slacker Coworker into Sabotaging Himself,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1fova4p/tricking_my_slacker_coworker_into_sabotaging/,"I work in an office with a guy I‚Äôll call ‚ÄúSeth.‚Äù Seth is that coworker everyone knows: lazy, always passing his work onto someone else, and somehow always getting away with it. He‚Äôll sit around on his phone or go to the bathroom every 10 minutes. He‚Äôs the kind of guy who will show up late, make some lame excuse about traffic, and then disappear for ‚Äúlunch‚Äù for two hours.

For the past six months, Seth‚Äôs favorite target has been me. He‚Äôll send emails asking if I can ‚Äúhelp out‚Äù with a project, but what he really means is, ‚Äúdo all the work while I take the credit.‚Äù I complained to my boss a couple of times, but somehow Seth always managed to weasel his way out of trouble. The final straw came when he passed off a major report that was due to a client in two days, dumping it on me last minute.

One day I casually asked him if he was good with Excel, and he admitted he didn‚Äôt know much about it. Perfect. The next time Seth tried to dump a bunch of spreadsheets on me to organize for his next report, I agreed. But this time, I embedded a series of *hidden formulas* into the documents. These formulas didn‚Äôt do anything important, just enough to mess with the numbers if someone didn‚Äôt know how to check for hidden cells. It took me a little time, but I was careful not to make it too obvious. The kicker? Every time Seth tried to copy and paste the data into his report, it would scramble everything just enough to be completely useless.

On the day the report was due, Seth slacked off like usual, assuming I had handled it like always. When the client called, furious because the report was filled with nonsense numbers, Seth panicked. He rushed to fix it, but every time he tried to fix one part of the report, something else would break. He came to me, frantic, and asked for help. I acted confused and said, ‚ÄúOh, I don‚Äôt know what happened! Maybe it‚Äôs a glitch?‚Äù I gave him some vague advice and watched as he spent the entire day trying to salvage his mess.

Our boss found out, and for once, Seth couldn‚Äôt talk his way out of it. He got lambasted for screwing up such an important project and was put on temporary leave without pay. I guess he‚Äôll be doing his own work from now on.",0
Oh I played the long game ,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1exnr27/oh_i_played_the_long_game/,"I am by no means an expert, or pro, at revenge but I am a patient person. I disclosed this to a friend and they directed me here. ThrowAway for obvious reasons, it's a long read but the setup and backstory are important.

7 years ago I was lucky enough to be able to buy my own place, I had saved for 10 years, worked my ass off, and I was so happy to be able to have a place to call my own.

Now, being a single person on the mortgage meant I had to make compromises, one such compromise was buying a property on a shared block (a lot cheaper). Where I'm from this usually means it's on a ""strata"" title. For some that's a bonus as it means there's a communal fund for repairs, typically insurance is cheaper as it's collective, and other things like maintenance being taken care of. Strata titles also come with a lot of by-laws and restrictions on what you can and can't do. I'm a pretty private and introverted person so having to deal with people and have limits on how I live was a no-no.

I took my time, found the perfect property. Shared block but freehold title. Only thing that was I needed to pay public liability insurance for the shared walkway on the property (split equally between owners). The real estate agent is local to my area, there's also about 3-degrees of separation between us, he has friends who are friends with my friends type of thing, didn't know him, but knew of him, so that sorta felt good too.

About 5 months after I move in I get a knock on the door from the owner (landlord) of the property next to me to discuss insurance. Not a problem, I ask for a copy of the policy so I have a record. It gets sent through and low and behold it's for strata insurance. I was incredibly confused and after much back and forth the property isn't a free hold title but a strata title. I called my lawyer who conveyed the title etc. He was dumbfounded but over it all did the right thing and made things as right as they could.

I arranged for a meeting with the real estate agent. I brought emails and printouts of the adds they had all saying it was free hold, emails between the real estate agent and my lawyer discussing it's freehold status, despite it being in absolute black and white he refused to accept any fault or offer anything to make things right. I don't begrudge that, he's looking out for himself, I get that. However I wouldn't forget it.

I did enter into mediation with the real estate agent and all I asked for was, when the time came for me to sell, they'd do it or cover the costs. I thought this was reasonable, but they flat out refused offered me 1k to go away, which I refused. I had the option to pursue them legally (and was advised by the mediator to do so) but ultimately I decided against it for a few reasons, the main one being my health at the time.

So I planned and plotted, and I schemed and connived as to how to get back at this son-of-a-bitch. And I settled on this.

I found his personal facebook page which wasn't set to private, saw some photos of a ""Boys on Tour"" trip he went on a few weeks prior (so about 5-6 months after I bought the property). I also found his address through a business registration search. On the anniversary of the sale, for 6 years straight, I sent them flowers with a note :-

""Dear Real Estate Agent  
Remembering you, on this, our special day.  
She has your eyes.  
Love Elle""

They varied ever so slightly over the years but always had ""on this our special day"" and some weird inference to a love child and a desire to reconnect.

I also from time to time arranged for postcards and letters to be sent from another country, the one he was ""On Tour"" in, always signed ""Love Elle"".

I learned about 3 weeks ago that this guy had recently divorced, lost his home and is not longer working as a real estate agent. His wife had found out he cheated on her. The story I was told (through said friends of friends) went along the lines of ""He would get weird gifts and flowers every year, same day, every year. She (his wife) finally put two and two together and realised what the date was and he admitted to cheating on her"".

Now, I didn't mean for this, but it turns out a year before I bought my house he had gone on holiday, came back with an STD, gave it to his wife but somehow convinced her that it wasn't him. As such ""our special day"" turned out to be right around the time he'd have been balls deep, sans condom, in someone who wasn't his wife, only one year earlier. 

He's apparently lost his house, half his retirement savings and also his business. I do feel a little bit guilty about all of it sometimes, but then I'm reminded that he's a scumbag and that Karma, like me, is a patient, spiteful and vengeful bitch.",0
"Cable company kept calling to recharge even after disconnecting service, booked tech support to fix non-existent TV box.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1enrrhw/cable_company_kept_calling_to_recharge_even_after/,"This is a repost. Earlier post on r/pettyrevenge got removed. Story is from 2021.

My old TV finally broke down, so I got a new smart tv. Couple weeks later I realized that no one in the family watches any TV channels, everyone goes for streaming content. I decided that it's not worth it to pay for the TV connection anymore. Now, my TV connection is added into my phone plan along with my Internet as well, so disconnecting it was not straight forward. It was a custom plan with its own dedicated relationship team. It took several calls to the team to find a resolution, which was to convert the TV connection to a prepaid one and then stop recharging.

After the conversion was done, I got messages for a few weeks to recharge and then finally a message to return the set top box. I responded to that and in a few days, the box was collected from my place. Good riddance. Or so I thought.

Next started calls from random call centers for recharging. It felt different from the dedicated relationship team. I googled and found out that this had become the practice in my country. The company had outsourced this part of the support to a 3rd party, and they simply checked from the printed database about people who had a connection, but did not recharge last month. Since my disconnection was in the middle of the month, and their printed database was from the beginning, they did not have this updated info.

I tried my best to inform them about this to no avail. I started talking to the callers informing them of the fake problem my TV was having connecting to the set top box and that multiple support requests have fallen on deaf ears. Also started recording the calls. 3rd caller took it seriously and booked tech support. Got a call from a field tech within hours. He came by. I greeted him with drinks and informed him about the real issue. We had a good laugh. He suggested that I keep it up a few more times for good measure.

After 8 tech support visits, finally they got the message. Got a call from a supervisor asking why I was booking tech support when clearly I didn't have a connection anymore. I mailed him the call recordings. He was pretty annoyed. But I stopped getting calls so much. Any call I get now (rarely, like once a couple weeks), I just read from the same script and if someone takes it seriously enough to try to book tech support, they get a short note against my id to not bother this gentleman.",0
We reverse gazumped a greedy landlord and it was glorious.,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1efqmr8/we_reverse_gazumped_a_greedy_landlord_and_it_was/,"‚ÄúGazumping occurs when an agent or seller accepts an offer you make to buy a property at an agreed price but the property is sold to someone else. This usually happens when the vendor sells the property for a higher amount.‚Äù

This happened 15 years ago and it is one of the proudest moments of my life.
My best friend and her husband have 5 kids together.  They lived in an expensive city and rented an old 4 bedroom house for $400 per week. The house was very rundown with a disgusting kitchen and stink drains but it was all they could afford at the time. Still, they made it work. 
The owner was a nice old lady who as extremely wealthy and very fond of my friend. She froze the rent for 5 years and promised to let them buy the house once they had saved enough to get a loan from the bank. As she had helped other people in a similar way, they knew they could trust her and so they saved every cent they could.
It took them 5 years but they finally told her they were ready..  Two days later, the nice old lady passed away; before anything was put in writing. üòî 

Enter the new owners. The lady‚Äôs 4 children. Each extremely wealthy in their own right; they inherited a huge portfolio of properties. When they first spoke to my friends, they assured them that the sale would still go through but they would have to wait until probate had settled. Confident, my friends started making some changes to the place. They started by stripping wallpaper, painting and making plans. Finally probate was settled and the owners agreed to go ahead with the sale for the previously agreed price. My friends applied for the loan but to their shock, it was refused.

The owners had raised the asking price by $80000 without telling my friends. To make things even worse, the house would be put on the open market. In 7 days there would be an Open House and, with the market the way it was, it would probably sell immediately.

My friends were devastated. They might be able to borrow enough but it would take longer than a week to get. To make matters worse, property prices and soared recently and rents had gone up a lot whilst theirs had been frozen.
Not only were my friends going to struggle to get the money. If the place was sold to someone else and they were asked for a higher rent or were evicted, it would be nearly impossible to find an affordable place with more than 2 bedrooms.

I was scared for my friends but I was also incandescently angry.  Those greedy sods were some of the wealthiest people in the city. They were screwing over a struggling family for less than $20000 each. They didn‚Äôt need the money. It as pure greed and it was obvious that they‚Äôd always planned to do this.

So while my friends scrambled to come up with the money, I started plotting.


I looked up advice on what helps to make a sale. We needed to make the place as undesirable as possible without making my friends look like bad tenants.

Uncluttered: We moved all the furniture in from the walls, added some extra furniture and borrowed ornaments and hung a load of motorcycle memorabilia on the walls. The place felt more smaller.

Smell: My friend boiled a head of cabbage on the stove and we sprayed ammonia around the front and back doors (because it smells like all the neighbourhood cats had been marking their territory). We also poured 2 dozen rotten eggs down the drain to make it smell like sewer gas ü§¢.

Neighbourhood: We obtained a mouldy old couch and dumped in front yard of the neighbour across the road (with permission of course).

Neighbourhood x2: We started calling friends for help. Anybody with a loud and crappy car was asked to do a few laps in front of the block during the Open Day. The street was unusually busy that day. Everyone we knew found a reason to drive by. It was practically rush hour.

Neighbourhood x3: We called out mates from the rugby club (full contact football without any of that soft padding). A big portion of our club are very large men. The next door neighbour set up a bbq in their front yard and we offered free food and cheap beer. They came on motorcycles, wearing their roughest gear. There was quite a crowd.

A lot of people showed up for the Open Day. Quite a few were in and out within minutes. One lady sat in her car and watched the party next door before driving away. 
The one bloke who stayed any length time, was brave enough to start up a conversation with someone leaving the party. He asked if they were often there and was told every couple of weeks or so, they have an after party morning and the party the night before was 3 doors up.
The party goer also helpfully mentioned the troublesome drains that are always getting blocked by tree roots and stinking up the place. The potential buyer left without making an offer.

So my friends were the only ones to make an offer. They still had to pay more than they‚Äôd planned but not as much as the greed bastards wanted. My friends signed the papers and paid the deposit that day. So when the brave buyer put in an offer of $30000 more than my friends, there was nothing the owners could do about it (strict anti gazumping laws).
I would have loved to see the owners faces when they found out. üòà





For all the people who are saying they had cheap rent. They didn‚Äôt. $400 was the rent in 2004 and that was pretty high back then. By the time the lady died, average rent for a house that size had only gone up by about $40. Nowadays, 4 bedroom houses in that area go for approximately $800 per week.",0
"Phone calls for the previous owner, who turned out to be my shitty manager",https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1eay1tl/phone_calls_for_the_previous_owner_who_turned_out/,"This is gonna be a long one. TLDR at the end. This could also go in AITA sub. You guys decide. Names have been changed to keep anonymity.

Mobile phones became common in my country around 2004, just as I finished high school. My parents bought me my first phone, a second-hand Nokia. It was bulky and basic, but I promised myself that someday I‚Äôd buy a new phone with my own money.

When college started, I had a 2-hour daily commute. In high school, I had excelled academically and won several district-level awards. These awards were being distributed during my first year of college. One nationalized bank award finally gave me enough money for a new phone. I bought a Sony Ericsson K300i and a premium SIM card, not realizing it had been abandoned by its previous owner.

By the third day, I started receiving calls for a guy named Bitsah from various financial institutions. It turned out the number previously belonged to him (and for 20 years, I've been getting these calls). Determined to keep my premium number, I began a routine of blocking wrong numbers. Back then, blocking was device-specific, so each time I got a new phone, I had to start over, keeping a list of numbers to block.

I got my first job after graduating in 2009. Around 2010, I was assigned to a new project with a notorious reputation for burning people out due to a nefarious project manager named Bits. I didn't know his full name for quite a while. He took pride in making our lives a living hell.

Bits ruled with an iron fist. From the moment his team stepped into the office, they were met with a barrage of emails and messages, each more urgent than the last. Bits thrived on creating chaos, often changing project deadlines on a whim, demanding his team work late into the night and through weekends.

Bits‚Äô presence loomed over every task. He insisted on micromanaging every detail, yet was quick to take credit for any successes, no matter how small. Failures, however, were met with his notorious tirades, publicly berating his team and assigning blame without hesitation. His unpredictable temper kept everyone on edge, afraid to make the slightest mistake.

Meetings were another tool in his arsenal of torment. He scheduled them during lunch breaks and after hours, ensuring no one could escape his grasp. These meetings were often pointless, serving only to reinforce his dominance and disrupt any semblance of work-life balance his team might have had.

His relentless stream of emails continued around the clock, each carrying a thinly veiled threat: perfection or dismissal. Under his reign, morale plummeted and burnout soared. Yet Bits remained oblivious, satisfied only by his complete and total control. I was quite ashamed when I learned that he was from the same area as I was and had gone to the same school, though years before me.

In 2012, our company merged with a parent company. Almost nothing changed personnel-wise, but infrastructure-wise we got MS Outlook and an organization view. That was when I first learned about Bits from an organizational hierarchy perspective. His full name was an eye-opener - it was Bitsah.

Now, the name was common enough, but at the time, mobile numbers had an area-specific pattern, so I already knew that the previous owner of my number was from the same area as me. Still, it could be someone else. I wanted to dig deeper.

I talked with an old mentor who lived in the same area and had coached several high-school students for the last two decades. He confirmed my suspicions. I won‚Äôt go into the details, but it was evident that Bitsah and Bits were the same person. I had been quite pissed with this unknown person named Bitsah for almost a decade by then, and Bits had been the bane of my (and several others') existence for quite some time.

This is where the revenge lies. First, I unblocked all the numbers in my phone. I was getting 5-6 calls daily on average, but after unblocking about 150 numbers, it increased to 15-18. My answering strategy changed drastically. Instead of saying ""Wrong Number,"" I politely explained that the owner had changed his number and provided his current number to update their database. This is where I could be the AH - I also volunteered his manager's number, in case he tries something else.

The fallout was epic. These people had been trying to find him for almost a decade. Banks had sold his debts to companies that harass people for a living to get their money back. It turned out, he had been taking loans in everyone's names (his wife, parents, uncles, aunts) and giving everyone that same number. He was evading credit card debt and loans of upwards of $200k (equivalent in USD, but it's a shitload of money where we are from). Apparently he had almost 20 cases filed against him, but no one could find him. Probably why he thought he could walk on water.

There are multiple versions of what happened at the office when his manager started to get calls about him. He was let go about 2 months later, haven't heard from him since.

**TLDR**: Previous owner of my number had duped several financial institutions. He later turned out to be my shitty boss. I informed the banks of his new number and his manager's number, leaving his career in shambles.",0

"Fired from my job, but received a years worth of pay and got my Boss fired.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1d8rrg6/fired_from_my_job_but_received_a_years_worth_of/,"This happened in the early 2010s, before the advancement of technology in video editing and content creation. I was hired as a content creator for a university that wanted to leverage YouTube to kickstart their branding campaign. The pay was low (roughly $2200 USD) and in those days, there were not that many video content creators around and the process usually took a long time from start to finish.

I was hired and on my 2nd day, my manager presented my KPI of 85 3-10 minute videos in 52 weeks which was impossible for a one-man team in those days. This meant I had to do the scripting, producing, casting talents, shooting videos, composing music (they were too cheap to pay for a royalty-free music subscription) and editing - all of which I had to use my own equipment and software because their cameras and computers were so old, they simply couldn't handle the strain of even doing things in 720p, much less 1080p. 

I tried to let my manager know but she just smiled encouragingly, telling me to give it a try, assuring me if the videos were good, the quantity would not be what she focused on. Hearing this, I agreed to give it a try.

My manager treated me well in the first month, however, one day when she found out I was a smoker, her attitude changed overnight. A colleague had actually done a facepalm when I told her about it and she let me know that the manager hated smokers and often advocated to get them fired. She started nitpicking me on everything, from smelling like cigarette smoke after my breaks, coming in 5-10 minutes late despite doing more than 4 hours of overtime daily, not being contactable during break times...the list goes on. But I soldiered on, because I just wanted to do the work and do it well.

5 months in, I was called into the Director's office where I saw my manager putting on her best ""displeased but gleeful face"" and I felt my stomach drop.

The director told me that she was disappointed because she had heard that I was falling behind on my work, and it was already halfway through the year and I had only completed 30 out of my 85 videos.  I tried to explain that I had been working my butt off on these videos, I literally worked 6 days out of the week, over 60 hours just to do what needed to be done and that being a 1 man army made things impossible, and also the fact that the videos I had put up grossed the highest views ever on their YouTube page. I also recounted how my manager said that she was looking for quality videos over quantity.

The director dismissed this and stated that the KPI was simply 85 videos in a year and since it was almost half a year in with my numbers at less than half, she felt it prudent to cut the cord early. I asked how would they even meet the KPI if they were to fire me now my manager had snorted, saying ""We'll find a PROFESSIONAL production house to finish your work."" The director had given her an odd look but nodded in her support nonetheless, telling me ""You don't need to worry, Manager will get the job done."" That was when a lightbulb went off in my head. 

Seeing as I was the content professional in the office, one of my jobs was to keep a database of production houses to use in the event we needed to do a shoot that required more resources, and I was sure that they would be using the production houses in my database as my manager had no contacts in the production industry. So, I changed the contact numbers and messed up all the emails on all of the entries except ONE. The one, I had a friend working as a junior director (not an assistant director, but a director assigned to smaller video projects). I gave him a call and told him of my plan, and sure enough within 2 days, they were called to come in to pitch.

I told him that I had a plan that was a win-win for us. It would instantly help him and put him on the fast track to a director position by bringing in that much business to his production house and it would also benefit me financially. I would teach him exactly how to pitch to win over the boss and the director and in turn, his company would pay me a standard finders fee of 15%. He agreed instantly and immediately put me on the line with his general manager who upon realizing this was to be 6 months of work for a high 6-digit payout, instantly agreed and drew up a contract.

As it turns out, after I gave them a metaphorical ""step-by-step playbook"" they were the ""perfect fit"", somehow understanding the needs and style of the university as well as the sort of themes the university wanted to feature. The director and my former boss were amazed that my friend's production house was so familiar with their content that they signed them up on the spot. 

Now, even back then using a production house back then was not cheap. Each video that they produced could cost double to triple my monthly salary given that they had specialized people for each function (Producer, Director, Director of Photography, Gaffer, Sound person, Video Editor, Assistant Director, Production Assistants etc), but this meant that they could complete a video every 2-3 days.

So yes, they produced 50 videos in a span of 4 months for over 100 months of my salary and I sat back and collected the healthy 15% which was about 15 months of my salary. This allowed me to put money aside for a holiday and the rest to further my studies with a respected film school overseas. I thought my plan ended here and I had gotten back at my former bosses, but to my surprise, I received a call from my colleague while I was holidaying in Bali one day. This was the same colleague who had facepalmed when I told her that my manager had found out that I was a smoker.

She told me that my former manager had been FIRED and my director given a massive blasting by the Chancellor of the University. The content creation project which I was hired for was only given a budget equating to about a year and a half of my salary and they had exceeded that budget by over 10 TIMES. My former manager was so desperate to ensure that her content creation project could be completed that she had thrown caution to the wind, paying anything to get the job done so that she could show my director that she had completed the project, and had approved the massive spend without getting consent from the director.

So that is how I got my friend a super fast promotion to a full Director in his production house, and a year of pay after getting unfairly fired from my job.

401k With A Side Of Revenge ,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1cw56x4/401k_with_a_side_of_revenge/,"Someone suggested I post this story over here‚Ä¶ enjoy! 

When our first child was born, my ex forced me to quit my job. When our 2nd child was 2, I found out about his affair. By then he was extremely verbally, emotionally and sometimes physically abusive. When he abused our first born, I put him out. That was in 2012.

I couldn‚Äôt afford daycare to work and had no family support. He refused to give me any money to take care of the kids saying ‚ÄúThe courts haven‚Äôt ordered me to give you a dime!‚Äù He lied to the bank and had my accounts frozen and even assaulted me when I filed for default in the divorce. 

The judge finally ordered him to pay child and spousal support 6 months after I kicked him out. It was 2562 a month. He refused to pay it until the garnishment kicked in and by then he was 6k behind in support. I used that to get permission to move away. 

I remarried a year after the divorce. I checked the court docs and there was a little box that said spousal support stopped upon remarriage if that box was checked. It wasn‚Äôt checked, so I figured I was good. Instead of filing for his retirement, I just took that year of spousal support (12k) and left it alone. (Spousal support was only ordered for 2 years) 

In 2017, he filed for sole custody of the kids out of nowhere. That was when he found out I had remarried and he had paid spousal support to me during the first year of my marriage. I told him I took that money instead of filing for my share of his retirement. I said if he let me keep that 12k, I wouldn‚Äôt file to split his 401k. He demanded that I repay the spousal support. The judge ordered me to repay it but increased child support and deducted the repayment from that. It ended up that I got an extra 20.00 a month and he repaid himself. He dropped his bid for custody in exchange for 2 extra weeks in summer. 

I pursued the retirement account split. He refused to cooperate and dragged it out for 4 years. It was so bad, they sanctioned him and he had to pay me 600 a month for a year in addition to child support. They also charged him with contempt. 

In Jan 2021, he proposed to his girlfriend. In May of 2021, I finally got the disbursement from his 401k. I won‚Äôt say how much it was, but it was about 4 times the amount of spousal support overpayment. I had no idea it would be that much. I had thought it would be around 12k which is why I thought keeping that year of spousal and not filing for his retirement account was a fair trade. Had he not tried to take the kids from me, I never would‚Äôve filed to split the account. Play stupid games‚Ä¶ win stupid prizes. 

His fianc√© emailed me recently and told me it is my fault he won‚Äôt marry her because I cleaned out his retirement account. She said I shouldn‚Äôt have ‚Äústolen‚Äù his money. I told her that I gave him the option to let me keep that year of spousal support or take it back and I could file for his retirement. He chose to have me file for his retirement. I told her that if he really wanted to marry her and protect his assets, they could get a pre-nup so he wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about it. She said she shouldn‚Äôt have to sign a pre-nup because I ‚Äúrobbed‚Äù him. 

I never asked to be financially dependent on him. He clearly indicated he wanted a court order to take care of his kids so I got him one. I tried to be fair and take the lesser amount by taking the spousal support and not filing for his retirement. He wouldn‚Äôt let me. 

In summary, my ex refused to pay me until support orders dropped, refused to pay until they revoked his license. Tried to get me in trouble for accepting spousal support over payment and in the end it cost him a lot of money out of his 401k.

Landlord put me through 3 years of hell. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1cjl5hn/landlord_put_me_through_3_years_of_hell/,"My landlord was a terrible human being. Honestly, calling him a human is even pushing it. Just a few things he has done to me over the past three years..

Stole my dryer and other household products that are in a common area.
Made me pay for a plumbing repair which was deemed normal wear and tear. 
Tried breaking into my house. 
Retaliated against me because I went to my lawyer after he sent me a letter about a parking spot. He tried charging me an extra $150/month. 

Mind you, I was never late for rent in 3 years, except for when he made me pay for the plumbing repair. So the next month I was a couple days late. 

The list goes on...Now this apartment was no where near nice. I found out the plumbing was illegal, he left me with a porch for years that has severe safety issues, the ceiling paint was always falling down, gas heater was not up to code, and so on. 

I finally got my chance to leave after he wanted to raise my rent $500/month. He will do anything, and everything to get more money out of his tenants. 

So I called the building inspector 4 days before I left. I told him everything. The porch when he finally replaced it didn't have a permit and was definitely not up to code. I told him about the plumbing and the heater. I went on and on. The inspector came over the very next day, I saw him taking measurements. Each violation is a $500/day fine until fixed. I honestly don't know what happened, but my God did it feel good to finally get him back. He's at the very least on the town's radar. 

A week before I moved out he tried telling me I needed to be out at a specific time.  I never responded and where I lived, that's not how it works.  He tried to threaten me with the police if I wasn't gone. Well, I went to the police myself that morning to warn them. The landlord did come by, threaten me and harass me. I called the police, they informed him I was in the right.

Long story short, he had broken into my apartment (I had left to go to storage) while I was gone.  He nailed my door shut. I told the police to get the supervisor because I was over being harassed by this guy.  Go figure he left before the supervisor could get there. I'm positive he knew he'd be arrested on site. 

Got the police report, they're charging him with a felony for breaking and entering.

Fines plus a charge? Don't be a jerk to good people.

"My landlord got not *exactly* what he deserved, but it sure was a rough ride for him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1cixe6i/my_landlord_got_not_exactly_what_he_deserved_but/,"i had a landlord who was pretty absent. i lived in this building (a high rise, like 20 stories) for 10+ years. he, despite living next door to me, was absent and cold personally but cool enough. rent was good, our agreement was NEVER bother him about anything unless its an absolute emergency.

shower head wonky? go buy a new one. fridge breaks? get it fixed, or dude just buy a new one. take it out of what you pay in rent. lost the receipt i DONT CARE i know more or less what a fridge costs just take it out of rent

finally his wife decides she wants more rent, wants to rent the place out as an office (not legal) and wants us out asap. i agree to move out a month early and get a month's rent back + deposit.

complete 180 on their part. ""the place is ruined, can't give you shit until you fix all this stuff"". 2 main things: my cats did scratch up the leather legs of the dining table, and the pull-up bar made 2 dents in the door frame of the kitchen, which was quite nice hardwood. they come to me with this list of TONS of stuff like oh you hang a photo frame here, this tile is slightly chipped.

this is the busiest work time of the year for me but im trying to be cooperative, sure, i got the table legs re-leathered, spackle the photo frame wall hole. can't do anything about the door frame, take it out of deposit. patch the tile. like dozens of little everyday-wear-and-tear things, like you want me to change the window screens? these are all new screens and in nicer shape than when i moved in! but i did them all, i trusted the guy. gotta get my money

at the end he should have been giving me 24k rmb (~¬£2500). he gave me FIVE. ""i still need to use the money to fix all that stuff, if you can't accept the five, i can't give you anything at all."" i was super pissed off but took the five.

now, people in the building are gossipy. i dont participate but i did tell this one older lady about my frustration. she told EVERYONE. the wife went from being the star of the ""mommies group"" of the building to nobody wanting to talk to her. people shunned the guy, too. i originally told them i was planning on moving to another city but an opportunity came up and i ended up renting a similar unit in the same building. so they thought they could just screw me over and not have to see me, but now they still did. often.

a year later the office calls me with some question about how to do something with the floor heating, i go... door frame is not fixed, still has dents, i call the guy like ""what the hell, man"" and he tells me to mind my own business

5 years later... i see the light at my old place is still on at 3am. huh, that's odd. i go to check, the door is open, and the place is just trashed, ruined. cabinets broken, stuff on the walls ""lazy landlord""... and the dents on the kitchen door frame are still there. so the guy never fixed anything, just kept my money

by this time smartphones were popular and we had a chat group for the whole building, so about 500 people. i took pictures and posted everything. apparently he had also nicked these peoples deposit, and there was a huge ruckus when they trashed the place, cops called. all these people chime in with complaints, and pictures. people smoking in the hallways, leaving leaky rubbish outside the front door, videos of people using foul language in front of children, dirty footprints.

he got fined a lot for 1: creating a public disturbance 2: degrading the quality of the living space 3: illegally renting a residence as an office and to top it off the building management wouldn't grant him permission to have workers in to fix the place, so it sat there empty for like 6 months. the fines were big, too.

take ~1.5 month's rent from me, lose a year's rent. suck it, bro.",0
Got rude guy arrested for suspended license. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1c8zrvd/got_rude_guy_arrested_for_suspended_license/,"This story takes place about 20 years ago. 

In the mid 2000s my friends and I would frequent a small billiards place in a neighboring town where you could rent a table by the hour or play per game.  We‚Äôd play a few games, watch whatever sports were on TV, and have casual conversations. There were no problems and no drama until about 3 months of us visiting this place. 

A guy shows and takes our spot at the billiards table. No big deal. We were all chatting anyway. 20 min later my friend lets him know we want to play next game and the jerk is super dismissive. 

Needless to say, we didn‚Äôt get in during the next game. So I politely let him know we wanted to play next. Another lady chimed in she wanted the game after us. The guy blatantly ignored me and the other woman. 

Some more time going by and the guy leave the table. We see our chance to get in. We put the quarters in and the balls are dispensed- except the green ‚Äú6‚Äù ball. The guy took it to the bathroom with him. 

At this point it was ridiculous and we notified the manager. The manager noted it was 12:30 and they were going to be calling last call and closing so he didn‚Äôt want to make a scene by kicking him out. He gets us another ball so we can play. 

The guy comes out of the bathroom and knows we realized what he did. He smirks and proceeds to the  patio to have a cigarette, bringing along his beer and the green billiard ball. 

The guy comes back in and tossed the ball he was holding onto the table hitting a few balls on the table and messing up our game. He goes up to the bar just in time for last call. 

One of the friends I was with suggested we follow him home and each call the highway patrol to report a suspected drunk driver. 3 of 4 of us agree. So when he leaves we used our trusty Nextel push-to-talk phones and coordinated several calls to the police. We provided details like license plate, vehicle make and model and color, and mentioned the car nearly hit another vehicle, was swerving between lines and driving erratically. This was under a 15 minute plan. We had no idea where the guy lived but suspected it was close as he was visiting a neighborhood place so our time was limited. 

The one guy who didn‚Äôt notify the police tailed the jerk and called us giddy when a police officer pulled between him and the guy and turned in his lights to pull him over. The police blotter that week included an arrested of a guy who was pulled over after multiple calls of erratic driving. He wasn‚Äôt arrested for DWI but instead for driving on a suspended license. 

TLDR: guy was a jerk at a local billiards club so we got him pulled over by the cops and he was arrested for driving in a suspended license.
